            <p>Hello, We are The United Military(UM) and we are a multi-platform based group id like to start by introducing the group. The United Military has been up sence 2014 as of right now we are on miltiple different consoles and platforms such as: Ps4, Xbox1, PC, Last Gen Consoles and we are even on Mobile Games. UM has a past and we dont feel there is any better way to move past it then to let it out and this is where our "Story" begins at the start of the group.</p>

            <p>When The United Military first began we we just a small GTA Crew based on PlayStation we all thought that we could handle getting bigger and for a while we did, after we started getting bigger we began getting more friendly in the milsim community and we started making alliances we started our alliances with a similar thinking Group called the Freedom Fighter Fleet (FFFF) we were going strong with them for a while now this is when things started to go downhill and it a very bad way, About a month after we allianced with FFFF our former President had a run in with a member of a crew called Blood Phantoms PMC this crew was apart of an even bigger coaliton called The United Nations Alliance(UNA) now for those of you who dont know these guys the UNA are Cyber Criminals the leader was exposed for going after children online as a preditor and he recruits people into his crew only to teach them to Boot People offline, so this is where our crew comes in we had joined this coalition unaware of what this the leader of this crew was doing we were with him for a good 3+ years until we relized that all he was doing was using us to go after children online, after we came to this relization we decided that we would do what ever it took to get him off the game to protect any other kids from coming in contact with him. and in doing so we had lost soe good members to him and we had to learn to defend ourselves as i stated he boots people offline for the fun of it. Now days this crew and coalition are scared of our crew as are most other crew on the game we like to pride ourselves in know that if someone needs our help we will be there and that there is no one that can prevent us from doing just that. </p>
